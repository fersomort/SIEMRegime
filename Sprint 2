<h4>SIEM REGIME AWS COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN</h4>

<p>
SIEM REGIME has created roles, users, groups, policies, and permissions for each organization
to utilize and control.

An IAM role is a set of permissions that can be assumed by an entity, such as a user, application,
or service. Roles are not users, but rather a set of permissions that can be granted to a user or
service. Roles are used to grant access to AWS resources without sharing the user's credentials.

An IAM user is a unique identity within your AWS account. Users are used to authenticate with
AWS services and can be granted access to specific resources. Each user has a unique username
and password and can be associated with one or more roles.

An IAM group is a collection of IAM users that you can manage as a single unit. Groups can be
used to simplify access management and make it easier to manage permissions for multiple
users.

An IAM policy is a set of permissions that define what actions can be performed on specific
resources. Policies can be attached to IAM users, groups, or roles, and can be used to grant or
deny access to specific AWS resources.
<br>
Permissions are the specific actions that can be performed on AWS resources. There are two
types of permissions: <br>
</p>
<p>

1. Actions: Specific actions that can be performed on an AWS resource, such as "S3: List Buckets" or "EC2: Describe Instances".<br>
2. Resources: The specific AWS resources that the actions can be performed on, such as a specific S3 bucket or an EC2 instance.


SIEM functionalities and secure virtual network architecture within the cloud platform is used to
segregate SIEM components and manage data access for AWS. The following will be considered
as components:

<h5>Network Segmentation:</h5>

Create multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs) to segregate SIEM components, each with its own
security group and network ACLs. This will help prevent lateral movement in case of a breach.

<p>
<h5>Subnets:</h5>

Create separate subnets for each SIEM component, such as: <br>
● Log collection (e.g., CloudWatch logs, AWS Config logs) <br>
● Log analysis and correlation<br>
● Alerting and notification <br>
● Data storage and retention <br>
Attached below is our AWS account subnets from the VPC. <br>

<h5>IAM Roles:</h5> 
Assign specific IAM roles to each SIEM component to control access to resources and services. <br>
For example: <br>
● A log collection role with read-only access to CloudWatch logs <br>
● A log analysis role with read-only access to S3 buckets containing log data <br>
● An alerting role with write access to SNS topics for notifications <br>
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is <br>
a critical component of securing and managing access to sensitive security-related data. 

<h5>RBAC Examples:</h5> 
● Security Analyst Role: This role has permissions to view logs, configure alerts, and access sensitive data. <br>
● Network Administrator Role: This role has permissions to manage network devices, configure network settings, and access sensitive data. <br>
● Compliance Officer Role: This role has permissions to view logs, configure alerts, and access sensitive data for compliance purposes. <br>
By implementing RBAC in a SIEM system, organizations can improve security, simplify management, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. <br>

<h5>IAM Policies:</h5>
Create IAM policies to define the permissions for each SIEM component. <br>
For example: <br>
● A policy that allows a log collection role to read CloudWatch logs <br>
● A policy that allows a log analysis role to read S3 buckets containing log data <br>
● A policy that allows an alerting role to write to SNS topics <br>

<p>
<h5>Network Access Control Lists (ACLs):</h5>
Configure network ACLs to control incoming and outgoing traffic between subnets and VPCs. <br>
For example: <br>
● Allow incoming traffic from the internet to the log collection subnet <br>
● Allow outgoing traffic from the log analysis subnet to the data storage subnet <br>
● Deny all incoming traffic from the internet to the data storage subnet <br>
Attached below is a photo from our AWS account to display the NACLs. <br>

<p>
<h5>Security Groups: </h5>
Configure security groups for each subnet to control incoming and outgoing traffic. <br>
For example: <br>
● Allow incoming traffic from trusted IP addresses or AWS services to the log collection subnet <br>
● Allow outgoing traffic from the log analysis subnet to the data storage subnet <br>
● Deny all incoming traffic from the internet to the data storage subnet <br>

<p>
<h5>Data Encryption: </h5>
Encrypt all data in transit and at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. This  includes encrypting log data, configuration data, and any other sensitive data such as multi-factor authentication. 

<h5>Monitoring and Logging:</h5>
Monitor and log all network traffic, including security group and network ACL changes, using AWS CloudWatch logs and CloudTrail. Amazon S3 is a popular choice for storing logs because it provides a scalable, durable, and secure storage solution. Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a fully managed log service that collects, monitors, and stores logs from AWS services, including EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, and more. <br>
With this architecture, you can ensure a secure and compliant virtual network architecture for
your SIEM components in AWS.
